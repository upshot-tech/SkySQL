# SkySQL

6105 MB demo: https://siasky.net/_AYYC9KGq009LF8mD1D2J6yjCoBm0i9yLR64pTX3aOWL6Q/index.html (13 million rows, 615 MB total size)
Demo with Upshot's exported PostgreSQL database: https://siasky.net/LAACIfwGOUkY4WIW4262qCjKi8ihLhMJwWG-2W2AuB5ymA/

While [MiniSearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch) and [AlaSQL](http://alasql.org/) are great in-browser full-text & SQL engines,
they can not handle GBs of data because of RAM limits.
SkySQL is a bit different. It is a modified [Radix-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) (or radix trie) based file index.

# Performance

SkySQL stores the data in alphabetical order in multiple files, and even if you has a tons of data, it will make only a few HTTP AJAX requests to find something:

- 1000 rows = 1 ajax request
- 1 million rows = 2 requests
- 1 billion rows = 3 requests
- 1000 billion rows = 4 requests

To add/update 1 row, you need to change the same amount of files that are required for lookup (1-4).
If you're building on [Sia Skynet](https://siasky.net), it is recommended to store the link of the latest index
file in a Skynet registry, so your users can access the updated database on the same link.

# Use-case examples

Presonally, I'll use SkySQL to host [SkyLive](https://skylive.coolhd.hu) 100% to Skynet and to make a fully decentralized search engine, [DappDappGo](https://dappdappgo.coolhd.hu).
You can create a searchable dictionary or a decentralized Twitter where users can find other users profile pictures, etc.

# Developer SETUP

- Install PostgreSQL or MySQL. For MySQL testing, you can use the `generator/examples/example_database.sql`.

- Install NodeJS

- Include the code from `generator/examples/example.js` to your project.

Enjoy! SkySQL will
